                            <p>Murlikant Petkar's story is one of incredible resilience and triumph. Born on November 1, 1944, in Maharashtra, India, Petkar served in the Indian Army until he was severely injured in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, resulting in a permanent disability. Refusing to let this setback define him, he turned to sports, excelling in swimming, javelin, shot put, and table tennis. His relentless pursuit of excellence led him to the 1972 Paralympic Games in Heidelberg, Germany, where he made history as the first Indian to win a Paralympic gold medal, setting a world record in the 50-meter freestyle. Petkar's achievements and pioneering spirit continue to inspire countless athletes with disabilities, proving that true champions are defined by their response to challenges. Honored and celebrated, his legacy remains a beacon of hope and resilience.</p>
